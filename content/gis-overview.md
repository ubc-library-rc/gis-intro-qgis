# Overview: Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

In this case, GIS is an abbreviation for Geographic Information System. A nice description of GIS that provides a bit of relevancy comes from QGIS's [*A Gentle Introduction to GIS*](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/introducing_gis.html):

  >*Just as we use a word processor to write documents and deal with words on a computer, we can use a GIS application to deal with spatial information on a computer*

With that in mind, there are 3 main forms of GISs:
1. **Utilities and Services (tasks)** - Scripts and programming libraries that manipulate spatial data in specific ways. For example, [**geocoding**](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geocoding/what-is-geocoding.htm) services geolocate a set of points based on address or coordinate attribute data. [MMQGIS](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mmqgis/) is a QGIS plugin which contains a tool for geocoding. 

2. **Desktop (analyses)** - Software that provides a suite of tools for processing and spatially analyzing data. In other words, GIS applications you interact with through a graphical user interface from a computer. Examples include the QGIS desktop app we will use today and Esri ArcGIS Pro. 

3. **Infrastructure (management)** - Server and web resources that manage, curate, and distribute collections of spatial data. While Esri offers Server web services with ArcGIS Online, many [open source GIS servers](https://mapscaping.com/open-source-gis-servers/) are out there.
