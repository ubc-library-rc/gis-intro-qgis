# Overview: Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

In this case, GIS is an abbreviation for for Geographic Information System. A nice description of GIS that provides a bit of relevancy comes from QGIS's [*A Gentle Introduction to GIS*](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/introducing_gis.html):

  >*Just as we use a word processor to write documents and deal with words on a computer, we can use a GIS application to deal with spatial information on a computer*

With that in mind, there are 3 main forms of GISs:
1. **Utilities and Services (tasks)** - Scripts and programming libraries that manipulate spatial data in specific ways.
2. **Desktop (analyses)** - Software that provides a suite of tools for processing and spatially analyzing data.
3. **Infrastructure (management)** - Server and web resources to meant manage, curate, and distribute collections of spatial data.
