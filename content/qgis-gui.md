# QGIS Graphical User Interface (GUI)

**Toolbars** - Toolbars are where you will find the most useful geoprocessing, editing, navigation, and other tools. You can customize this area of your GUI to fit your needs.    
<br>
**Browser and Layers Panel** - The browser panel lets you easily navigate your file system for data and project files. Your layers panel displays your project's data layers and provides access to configuration settings.
<br>
**Status Bar** - The status bar displays current information about the map canvas, and allows you to make adjustments in the map's scale and rotation.    
<br>
**Map Canvas or Map View** - Call it either one. This is where the map is displayed as layers are loaded. You can zoom/pan the map canvas as well as select features and other operations.
