<p>In this case, GIS is an abbreviation for Geographic Information System. A nice description of GIS that provides a bit of relevancy comes from QGISâ€™s <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/introducing_gis.html"><em>A Gentle Introduction to GIS</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Just as we use a word processor to write documents and deal with words on a computer, we can use a GIS application to deal with spatial information on a computer</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that in mind, there are 3 main forms of GISs:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Utilities and Services (tasks)</strong> - Scripts and programming libraries that manipulate spatial data in specific ways.</li>
  <li><strong>Desktop (analyses)</strong> - Software that provides a suite of tools for processing and spatially analyzing data.</li>
  <li><strong>Infrastructure (management)</strong> - Server and web resources to meant manage, curate, and distribute collections of spatial data.</li>
</ol>
