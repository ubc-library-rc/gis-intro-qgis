[QGIS](https://qgis.org/) is a popular desktop GIS software, and considered a free and open source software (FOSS) with a very active development community.

### QGIS Advantages  ⇡
 - Free and open source 
 - Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android
 - Extensive online documentation 
 - Intuitive interface
 - Active development and user communities, meaning people are constantly posing and answering questions on platforms such as Reddit and StackExchange. This makes troubleshooting a whole lot easier. 
 - Robust [plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/) repository for extended functionality


### QGIS Disadvantages ⇣
 - Most recent features can be buggy, which is why we recommend always downloading the latest Long Term Release, often small hyperlink below main download button. 
 - Plugins lack standardized documentation as they are largely user-community developed and contributed
 - Troubleshooting often amounts to searching the web, though this is an important skill to have as a cartographer.
