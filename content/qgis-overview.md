# QGIS
QGIS is a popular desktop GIS software, and considered a **f**ree and **o**pen **s**ource **s**oftware **(FOSS)** with a very active development community. According to [QGIS's development roadmap](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html), new versions are planned for release as far as 2 years into the future. For this workshop we are using QGIS 3.22.8 'Białowieża', the most recent long term release.
