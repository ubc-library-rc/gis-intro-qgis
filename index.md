# Introduction

This is an introductory workshop focusing on the fundamental concepts and skills needed to begin using **QGIS 3.22.7** exploring and analyzing spatial data. It is also meant to help you understand how to get started composing a map document for print production. **The instructions below will follow a brief presentation overviewing the QGIS 3.22.7 and it's user interface.**

The result of this project will be a choropleth map showing the number of Douglas Firs lining the streets in each of Vancouver's neighbourhoods. We will compose and export this map for print.
